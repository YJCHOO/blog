I want to build up my reading habit in 2024. However, I didn't expect Britney Spears's book, "The Woman in Me," to be the first book I would finish reading this year.

I'm not a big Britney's fan. I born in 1997. So, I missed most of her's albums. But, I didn't miss the Femme Fatale.
Femme Fatale is my way to discover dance-pop. "Hold it againt me", "I wanna go" and "Till the world end" still relavent in nowsaday.
