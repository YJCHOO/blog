I don't like a lot of things about Blogger(Blogspot). But this is not a post to complain about my ex(Blogger). So, just talk about my migration plan from Blogger to Github Page.

The only thing I'm worried about is the Google Adsense. My current tech blog monetizes on Google Adsense. I don't want to lose the monetization while migrating to a new place. 

My plan is to run the dual system and fade out the old one. I will cross-post an article from the new to the old tech blog every month. Then, all the latest things will be exclusive to the new tech blog. Till the new blog gets monetized on Google Adsense.

I've already posted some articles on the [new blog](https://yjchoo.github.io/techblog). Feel free to check it.
