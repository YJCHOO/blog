My New Year's resolution is simple: 

Hit YouTube's monetization goal.
YouTube has two tiers of monetization. The first tier needs 500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours or 3 million Shorts views. The second tier needs 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours or 10 million Shorts views. 

For my current state, my YouTube channel has 316 subscribers and 350 watch hours. It's near the first-tier monetization. But I'm still struggling with the watch hours. I hope to hit the first tier in Q2 and the second tier in Q4 2024.

Let's review in December 2024.
