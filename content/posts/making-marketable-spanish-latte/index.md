I want to make a marketable Spanish Latte. But, I don't have any skills to make a good coffee. I did some research and hands-on. So, let's talk about the things I have learned recently.

The ingredients of the Spanish Latte mainly consist of espresso, milk, and sweetened condensed milk. 

I replace the espresso with instant coffee. I have a cheap espresso machine, but the extraction and taste are not good. I don't think it's worth the time and cost. 

My first attempt to make 2 Spanish latte used 2 slightly different instant coffee: Nescafe Gold and Nescafe Classic. Both of the Spanish Latte taste plain. The Nescafe Gold one tastes smoother, and the other's coffee tastes stronger(but still bland). 

Here are my measurements: 
- 2 teaspoons of instant coffee.
- 180 ml of boiled water.
- 100 ml of milk.
- 1 teaspoon of sweetened condensed milk.

My second attempt is to reduce the boiled water. 180 ml of boiled water was reduced to 100 ml, and milk was increased to 120 ml. I only made the Spanish Latte with Nescafe Gold. The coffee tastes slightly better but is still bland and even milky.

My third attempt finally found the balance. My tester(sister) told me that. I adjusted the ratio of coffee and milk to 1:1 and added 1 more teaspoon of sweetened condensed milk. The Spanish Latte tastes well-balanced; the coffee is strong, and even part-frothed milk makes it milky and creamy.
