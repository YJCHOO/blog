I really like bubble milk tea, to be honest. Without the chewy bubble/boba, that's no reason to drink milk tea, except Teh Tarik. But in this post, I only focus on the main character——milk tea. 

I don't know how to make a good milk tea. So, I did some digging on Google. 

Most recipes will put tea and milk in a 1:1 ratio. I believe that's the golden ratio. I start with the ingredients below for 3 servings:
1. 450 ml water.
2. 12 g black tea leaf(broken).
3. 450 ml fresh milk.

The preparation is as follows:
1. Boil 450 ml water.
2. Bring the water to a simmer.
3. Add 12 g tea leaves to steep for 45 seconds.
4. Add milk and heat it till 70 ~ 80 °C.
5. Serve.

I think the milk tea tastes ok and marketable. But the tea can get stronger. I made bubble(Tapioca pearl) a few times in the past. It's takes too much time to make it, and I don't feel it worth the time. A pre-made bubble is definitely a better option.
