[{"content":"I want to build up my reading habits. But I always fail. That is why I\u0026rsquo;m still reading How to Avoid a Climate Disaster by Bill Gates after two years.\nI believe I will finish this book this year(I still have faith in my own). It\u0026rsquo;s almost finished, 81% now.\nSo, I start looking for a new book about focus and concentration. I try to get my book free and legal. Then, I found that the National Library of Malaysia has an E-book platform. It integrates with Libby, requiring a library card to access. I registered a library card on the website with my IC(Yes, Malaysia IC is mandatory.) and use it in Libby. After scrolling through the e-book library, I was disappointed with the limited e-book selection.\nI did some further research. I found that many countries have public libraries and provide e-books through Libby. I get an address from Google and register a library card in the US. After I connected my US library card with Libby, the e-book selection increased significantly.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s actually quite easy to do it. Don\u0026rsquo;t ask me how to do it. Google is your best friend.\n","permalink":"https://yjchoo.github.io/blog/posts/build-up-reading-habit/","summary":"I want to build up my reading habits. But I always fail.

This ALEX Storage Unit doesn\u0026rsquo;t have drawers. It\u0026rsquo;s a cabinet, only has a single door and an adjustable shelf inside.\nThe ALEX Storage Unit usually costs RM 249. Last month(November 2023), IKEA had a discount for IKEA Family Members for RM 199 at the IKEA Damansara outlet.\n(Image above from IKEA Cheras Fan Club Facebook)\nThis time, IKEA Family offers 50% off Top Seller Edition, lowering the price of the ALEX Storage Unit to RM 124.\nI think this is the right time to buy and bring it home. So, I went to IKEA and brought it home two days ago. I was surprised that different places had different colors on offer. The image above is from IKEA Cheras, which is white on sale. I got it from IKEA Damansara, which is grey turquoise on sale.\nI spent a whole day assembling the IKEA storage unit and rearranging my room furniture.\nWhy did I spend a day installing a cabinet?\nALEX storage unit is only compatible with IKEA tabletops: LAGKAPTEN, MÅLSKYTT, and ANFALLARE. My tabletop is LINNMON 100x60cm. This tabletop doesn\u0026rsquo;t have pre-drill holes for ALEX storage unit. I just left one side table without legs and put it on ALEX storage unit.\nThis setup creates another problem. The legroom became narrow. I can\u0026rsquo;t even place my chair under the table. Also, my dog wants to sleep under there.\nLuckily, I got 2 LINMON 100x60cm tabletops, and my room has enough space. Therefore, I combine two LINMON tables horizontally, two pairs of ADILS table legs for each end, and ALEX storage unit in the middle as supporting.\nThe ALEX storage unit and the tabletops are unfixed, which they may dislocate. I keep it this way for now. I may rearrange it. You can use adhesive tape or screws to fix it properly.\nThe result: By the way, I just don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to do cable management.✌️\n","permalink":"https://yjchoo.github.io/blog/posts/ikea-alex-storage-unit-good-deal/","summary":"Firstly, not to confuse the ALEX Storage Unit and the ALEX Drawer Unit.

Sometimes, I bought something from the online store. I will leave it at some place and not unbox the parcel.\nWhy did I buy something but don\u0026rsquo;t use it? Also, I may get a faulty product. It\u0026rsquo;s such a waste.\nRecently, I got a Sonoff SwitchMan M5 Smart Switch. Because I\u0026rsquo;m procrastinating, it\u0026rsquo;s been in my drawer for about a month. I plan to create an automation with my DIY Human Presence Sensor.\nYesterday, I finally had some motivation. So, I decided to stop being a couch potato. The installation of the Sonoff SwitchMan M5 goes well. I double-check to make sure all the wiring connections are correct.\nBut, when I switch on the circuit breaker, the Earth Leakage Circuit Beaker(ELCB) trips instantly.\nThis Sonoff SwitchMan M5 smart switch needs a neutral wire. Malaysian houses usually don\u0026rsquo;t use neutral wire in light switches, only live wire.\nBack in the day, I requested the electrician to add a neutral wire for each light switch. They may mess up the neutral wire for this light switch point.\nI need a quick solution. Here are the possible solutions. Ask the electrician back to fix it. But, the work is a long time ago. So, it may had some charges. Buy a smart switch that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a neutral wire or Zigbee version. I believe I will take the second. I want to buy a Zigbee version smart switch, so I don\u0026rsquo;t need to install a capacitor. I\u0026rsquo;m just waiting for the Shopee 1.1 sales. I hope I can get a good deal.\nI also firm the whole installation process. I plan to make a YouTube Shorts. Now, I have to change it.\n","permalink":"https://yjchoo.github.io/blog/posts/install-smart-switch-cause-elcb-trip/","summary":"I think this is a bad behavior.
